# 1.1.b L2 and L3 switches

## The definition of a switch

* Receives data "packets" \(frames\) and directs them to their destination.
* Connects cables that are connected to devices
* Learns MAC addresses and stores them into a CAM \(Content Addressible Memory\) table.
* Forwards or Floods data.

{% hint style="info" %}
The term "packets" in a layer 2 context is actually technically incorrect, but usually the term is used as a force of habit. On layer 2, data is composed of frames.
