In a home environment usually the "wireless router" performs the job of an ethernet switch, wireless access point, router and firewall all by itself. The physical topology would be much simpler and just comprise of your home router.

For the Internet connection, the router \(combo\) device connects with any available Internet access technology, including cable Internet, DSL, 4G/5G wireless, or fiber Ethernet.
