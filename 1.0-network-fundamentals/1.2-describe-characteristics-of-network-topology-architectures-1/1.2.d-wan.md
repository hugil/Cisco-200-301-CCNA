# 1.2.d WAN

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| access link | The physical link between the customer and the WAN service provider |
| UNI \(user network interface\) | The context of the service provider's network all the way to the user  \(a [demarcation point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demarcation_point) between the responsibility of the service provider and the responsibility of the subscriber.\) |

## Metro Ethernet

![](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2820%29.png)

Metro Ethernet acts much as if the WAN-service were created by one Ethernet switch.  
Each router is connected to the WAN service with an Ethernet link of some kind; those Ethernet links typically use one of the fiber Ethernet standards due to the distances involved. From the customerâ€™s perspective \(that is, from the perspective of the enterprise that is the customer of the WAN SP\), the WAN service acts like a LAN switch in that it forwards Ethernet frames.

MEF \(www.mef.net\) defines the standards for Metro Ethernet, including the specifications for different kinds of MetroE services.

### Ethernet Service Types & Topologies

| MEF Service | Topology | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Ethernet Line Service | Point-to-point | Two customer premise equipment \(CPE\) devices are connected over the WAN similarly to a leased line. |
| Ethernet LAN Service | Full mesh | This service acts like a LAN, all devices and send frames to all other devices. |
| Ethernet Tree Service | Point-to-multipoint / Partial mesh | A central site communicates to a defined set of remote sites. The remote sites cannot communicate directly and would have to go through the central site. |

## Multiprotocol Label Switching \(MPLS\)
