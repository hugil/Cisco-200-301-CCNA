# 1.2.a 2 tier

A two tier network architecture is the concept of creating a distribution layer using network switches.  
In contrast to a totally flat network with daisy chained switches where every single switch is a single point of failure \(if one fails, all go down\). 

A two tier network has Core switches and Access Switches.  
Core switches reside "above" the Access Switches in the network topology taking care of VLANs, Routing QoS, Access Control etc.

Access Switches are then used to connect all the client devices.
