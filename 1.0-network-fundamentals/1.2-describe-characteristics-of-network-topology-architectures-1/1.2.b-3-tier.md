# 1.2.b 3 tier

The third tier architecture builds upon the two tier architecture by essentially putting another pair of core switches OR interconnecting them above the distribution switches in the network topology.

Why a pair? Because redundancy!

Usually these core switches reside in another central building which several other sites with tier 2 networks connect to.
