# IPv6

#### What we know about IPv4 can be transferred to IPv6

* Generally inherits the usage and properties of IPv4 except of the address shape \(hexadecimal\).
* IPv6 is also layer 3 addressing.
* IPv6 ranges also have a network and host address.

IPv4 is dotted decimal while IPv6 is hexadecimal.  
IPv6 subnet masks cannot be written the same way as IPv4 in decimals, hence usage of CIDR exclusively.

### Remarkable difference: The concept of a Global Address

Every IPv6 device will have multiple addresses but one global address \(public address\).
