The OSI model is the preferred reference model for describing network communications.  
The TCP/IP protocol is the preferred protocol stack in most networks today.

There exists a OSI protocol but it failed to become widely adopted at the early inception when TCP/IP had already been established. This is why the use of TCP/IP has now become standard.

Frame, a chunk of data, with a Data Link Layer header. The frame encapsulates the packet which contains a segment that contains the payload.

### 1 - Physical Layer

At the physical layer the information is transferred by means of electrical signals, over a medium like copper or fiber.
